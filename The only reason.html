        It started out in summer actually, JP cooper get it right.. but you
        literally spoke to me at last. And I'm sure I knew that the only reason
        God gave me eyes was to see things that you dont particularly find nice
        so that you can say " As long as o le Happy" and as long as ke le happy
        for realüò≠ The only reason God gave me ears was to never hear your
        advice even though it's sound. I will always love you Chomamüíï. With the
        dreams that we've shared watching you achieve yours has been one of the
        most beautiful experiences in my life. When the wind gets cold, I hope
        you get rich to afford us an AC because keeping you warm with my arms or
        building a fire is wildüò≠üò≠üò≠ I'm definitely not the cooling voice,
        Shadows will definetly scare you if I'm there, I literally thought there
        were ghosts ko respbulica. I will however always be the supportive voice
        behind your dreams, goals, decisions and choices. I will infact always
        always always LOVE YOU‚ù§üíï
